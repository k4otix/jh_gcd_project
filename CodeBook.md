## Summary of raw data

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

>For each record it is provided:

>- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
>- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
>- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
>- Its activity label. 
>- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

>The dataset includes the following files:

>- 'README.txt'

>- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

>- 'features.txt': List of all features.

>- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

>- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

>- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

>- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

>- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

>The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

>- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

>- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

>- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

>- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

>Notes: 

>- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
>- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

## Study Design

The data used in this project is part of the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) and was downloaded as a .zip.  The data was then processed by the run_analysis.R script as described in the Transforms section of this document.

## Variables

See the follwing files (part of the .zip archive) for a full description of variables and units:  
- README.txt  
- features_info.txt  
- features.txt  

## Transformations
1. Read in the following files:  
  - 'features.txt'  
  - 'activity\_labels.txt'  
  - 'train/subject\_train.txt'  
  - 'train/X\_train.txt'  
  - 'train/y\_train.txt'  
  - 'test/subject\_test.txt'  
  - 'test/X\_test.txt'  
  - 'test/y\_test.txt'  
2. Combine 'X\_train' and 'X\_test' into a single data set  
3. Label the columns of the combined data set with the features in 'features.txt'  
4. Create a subset of the data based on column names that match the regular expressions `mean.*()` and `std.*()` per project instructions  
5. Rename the columns  
  - remove parentheses  
  - replace hyphens with underscores  
6. Bind activity labels to data set, replace integers with matching values from 'activity\_labels.txt'  
7. Add subject identifiers to the data set with values from 'subject\_train.txt' and 'subject\_test.txt'  

## Tidy data set

The next part of the assignment was to summarize the data and create a new tidy data set.  The new data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  To do this, I used the dplyr library and performed the following steps:  

1. Create a data set called "tidy" using the `group_by()` function, passing "Subject" and "Activity" as parameters  
2. Pass this grouped data to `summarise_each()`, specifying "mean" as the argument to the "funs" parameter  
3. The new values in this tidy data set represent averages of each of the variables (by subject/activity), so prefeix each column name with the string "avg_" to make it more descriptive  
4. Write this final data set to the file "tidy.txt"
